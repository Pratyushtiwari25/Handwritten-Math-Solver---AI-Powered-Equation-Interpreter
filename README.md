**AI-Powered Equation Interpreter | March 2024 ‚Äì May 2024**

##  Overview

This project is an AI-powered application designed to **interpret and solve handwritten mathematical equations** using computer vision and symbolic computation. It provides an intuitive web interface where users can upload images of handwritten math expressions and receive real-time symbolic interpretation and solutions.

Built using **OpenCV**, **PyTesseract**, **SymPy**, and **Streamlit**, this tool is ideal for students, educators, and researchers looking to bridge the gap between handwritten inputs and digital computation.

## üìÇ Dataset

### CROHME (Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions)
- **Description:** CROHME is a standard benchmark dataset used for handwritten mathematical expression recognition.
- **Usage:** The dataset was used for:
  - Training and testing OCR accuracy on real handwritten expressions.
  - Evaluating performance in recognizing a variety of math notations.
- **Access:** [CROHME Dataset Info](https://www.isical.ac.in/~crohme/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-math-solver.git
cd handwritten-math-solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üì∏ Preprocessing Steps (OpenCV)

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Enhances contrast for OCR.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Reduces noise in handwritten strokes.
- **Thresholding (Binarization)**: Converts image to binary for OCR compatibility.

## üß† OCR + Parsing Pipeline

1. **Image Upload** via Streamlit UI.
2. **OpenCV Preprocessing** to clean image input.
3. **PyTesseract OCR** extracts math expression as string.
4. **SymPy** parses the expression and computes the result.
5. Output: Displayed in a side-by-side layout ‚Äî *Input Image*, *Recognized Expression*, and *Solution*.

## üìà Example

- Input: Handwritten image of `2x + 3 = 7`
- Output:  
  - Recognized: `2*x + 3 = 7`  
  - Solution: `x = 2`
